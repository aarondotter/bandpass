Because Bessell presents the filter throughputs as lambda*thruput(lambda)
the files Wash_[CMT1T2].dat have been refactored and normalized to be
thruput(lambda). The original curves are in filters.txt.
The reason for rescaling the filters is that the bandpass code performs
the integration as lambda*flux*thruput*dlambda.
